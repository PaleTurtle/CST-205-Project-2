How to run the program:
To run the screen recording program, follow these steps:
1.	Open the program in Linux and click on the play button. It will start recording.
2.	After recording, you will get an output file with your selected filename in MP4 format. 
3.	To exit the program, you can click on file and then on exit.

Future Work:
For the future, we plan to create a possibility to not only record audio from the microphone, but also from the computer or an application on the computer. The user will be able to choose, if he wants to capture the microphone or the computer. We will also try to create a functionality to capture video only from a part of the screen, in case a user canâ€™t play a video on full screen. We also want to improve the functionality of the program, for example, we are going to make it possible to stop recording by clicking a button instead of selecting the duration in advance. 
To make the program accessible for more people, we are going to work with a Windows and an Apple API to make the program usable for Apple and Windows. We will also create an online database, where users can share their video clips. We will also use Social Media APIs for the program and the database to enable sharing clips on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.
